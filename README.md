Dress-Color Suggesting Interface Based on Image-Processing (Python)(OpenCV)


Abstract             

     In shopping-malls and dress-stores people who are shopping the dresses depends on the color suggestions given by shop-suppliers and friends or some personal interests. But to make it more professional and extend the color-combination options for the dresses we collect several professional opinions from all around the world and based on the buyer’s physical appearance and other factors - we offer an interface which provides suitable set of color-combinations for dress chosen driven AI(Artificial Intelligence) directed by ML(Machine Learning).
     
     
Background art of the work	

     Earlier there is an approach for dress-color suggesting interfaces in developed - countries. Using OpenCV-Python Package used for Image-Processing we wanted to develop a similar product using some predefined and self-created algorithms for several Image-detail extractions like :
-	Face Detection		(pre-Defined but Customized to our requirement)
-	Color Detection		(Self-Created)
-	Face-Color-Detection	(Self-Created)
-	Object Detection		(pre-Defined but Customized to our requirement)
-	Face-Shape Detection 	(pre-Defined but Customized to our requirement)
-	Hair-Color Detection	(Self-Created)
-	Edge-Detection		(pre-Defined but Customized to our requirement)
-	Background Detection	(pre-Defined but Customized to our requirement)
-	Skin Detection			(pre-Defined but Customized to our requirement)
-	Color-Space Conversion/Translation	(pre-Defined but Customized)
-	Upper/Lower-body Detection	(pre-Defined but Customized to our requirement)
And finally, we use an Artificial-Machine-Learning-intelligence to give-up with nice color suggestions based on the color suggestions extracted from the image of the user/customer. 
                              
Introduction 		

    In our day to day life many of us are willing to buy dresses of different styles and themes. But confused which color suits them and dress best.so, our platform provides a wide-range of professional suggestions from all around the world based on the client/customer features. Python-OpenCV is a great library/package that provides us a great set of modules which can help in feature extraction.

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is released under a BSD license and hence it’s free for both academic and commercial use. It has C++, Python and Java interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android. OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. Written in optimized C/C++, the library can take advantage of multi-core processing. Enabled with OpenCL, it can take advantage of the hardware acceleration of the underlying heterogeneous compute platform.

Anaconda Distribution contains conda and Anaconda Navigator, as well as Python and hundreds of scientific packages. When you installed Anaconda, you installed all these too. You can try both conda and Navigator to see which is right for you to manage your packages and environments. You can even switch between them, and the work you do with one can be viewed in the other.
                                                     

Aim 

    Our main aim is to provide a platform that provides a wide-range of professional dress-color-suggestions from all around the world based on the client/customer physical appearance and structure.  

Packages and methods 

   We have used many python-packages and OpenCV-methods for developing the things in the project:
-	numpy
-	cv2
-	os
-	imutils
-	mysql.connector
-	PIL
-	configparse,argparse
-	colorsys


Techniques/databases  

By learning vast knowledge from Image-processing (OpenCV) we have implemented some modules or technical-algorithms which gives us efficient and optimal results.
And we have used MySQL-database for storing extracted features, image-details and suggestions given by the application.

 Results     
 
 In results section we give or the application receives an image or video from the webcam/camera and processes the image/video and returns us the images with several color suggestions.

Conclusion
	 	 	
This project is a great success and almost ready to be released. we have learnt a great many tools like git, OpenCV, Anaconda, complete-python understandment while we are engaged in the project.
This is a wonderful project which also deals with the color-spaces that exists and all about one should know about an image.
Specific achievements 
I did this project on with my own interest and curiosity and this is one of the big achievement to me and this project is successful.
This gave me a great experience how industry works and how everything works i the real world.
In this project there came situations to implement the code for optimal results which required a deep understanding in image processing and python and with which I had implemented some modules on my own based algorithms and I am very proud and glad as I did it on my own.
